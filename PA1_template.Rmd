## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("~/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/activity.csv")
View(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
daysums <- aggregate(activity$steps~activity$date, FUN=sum)
hist(daysums$`activity$steps`,breaks=seq(0,25000,by=1000))
mean(daysums$`activity$steps`)
median(daysums$`activity$steps`)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r echo=TRUE}
timemeans <- aggregate(activity$steps~activity$interval, FUN=mean)
timemeans$dectime <- timemeans$`activity$interval` %/% 100 + timemeans$`activity$interval`%% 100 / 60
plot(timemeans$dectime,timemeans$`activity$steps`,type="l")
timemeans$`activity$interval`[which.max(timemeans$`activity$steps`)]
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r echo=TRUE}
for (i in seq(1,length(activity$steps))) {
  if (is.na(activity$steps[i])) {
    activity$steps[i] <- mean(activity$steps[activity$date == activity$date[i]])
  }        
}
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("~/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/activity.csv")
# Convert to wide format
activityw <- reshape(activity, direction="wide", timevar="interval", idvar="date", v.names="steps")
# Make the column names equal to the times
colnames(activityw)[-1] <- substring(colnames(activityw)[-1],7)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
daysums <- rowSums(activityw[,-1], na.rm=TRUE)
hist(daysums,breaks=seq(0,25000,by=1000), main="Histogram of Daily Steps",  xlab="Steps")
cat("The mean number of steps per day is ",round(mean(daysums, na.rm=TRUE)),".\n", sep="")
cat("The median number of steps per day is ",round(median(daysums, na.rm=TRUE)),".\n", sep="")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r echo=TRUE}
timemeans <- colMeans(activityw[,-1], na.rm=TRUE)
# Calculate times in decimal hours and then do the plot.
dectimes <- 100 * (as.numeric(names(timemeans)) %/% 100 + as.numeric(names(timemeans)) %% 100 / 60)
plot(dectimes,timemeans,type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps", main=" Average Daily Activity Pattern")
cat("The maximum occurs in the interval starting at ",names(timemeans)[which.max(timemeans)],".\n",sep="")
```

## Imputing missing values

```{r echo=TRUE}
cat("The dataset had ",sum(is.na(activity$steps)), " rows with missing values.\n", sep="")

# Create a dataframe with NAs replaced with the mean for that time.
activityf <- activityw
for(i in 2:ncol(activityw)) {
  activityf[is.na(activityw[,i]),i] <- timemeans[i-1]
}

# Calculate the day totals again.
daysumsf <- rowSums(activityf[,-1], na.rm=TRUE)
hist(daysumsf,breaks=seq(0,25000,by=1000), main="Histogram of Daily Steps (after imputing missing values)",  xlab="Steps")
cat("The mean number of steps per day is now ",round(mean(daysumsf, na.rm=TRUE))," rather than ",round(mean(daysums, na.rm=TRUE)),".\n", sep="")
cat("The median number of steps per day is now ",round(median(daysumsf, na.rm=TRUE))," rather than ",round(median(daysums, na.rm=TRUE)),".\n", sep="")
cat("The total number of steps has",ifelse(sum(daysumsf, na.rm=TRUE) > sum(daysums, na.rm=TRUE),"increased.","decreased."))
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Calculate a vector of day names.
weekday <- weekdays(as.Date(activityf$date,format="%Y-%m-%d"))
#Calculate a vector of booleans indicating weekend days.
weekend <- (weekday == "Saturday") | (weekday == "Sunday")
#Caclculate the interval means for each and plot them.
weekdaymeans <- colMeans(activityf[!weekend,-1], na.rm=TRUE)
weekendmeans <- colMeans(activityf[weekend,-1], na.rm=TRUE)
library(lattice)
dfd <- data.frame(times=dectimes, means=weekdaymeans, daytype="weekday")
dfe <- data.frame(times=dectimes, means=weekendmeans, daytype="weekend")
df <- rbind(dfd,dfe)
xyplot(means~times|daytype, data=df, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of steps",layout=c(1,2), ylim=c(0,250))
```
